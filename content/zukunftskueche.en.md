During the second semester of my studies in one of the courses called "Medieninformatik 2", we we're asigned the task to develop a cooking simulation for web browsers. We were allot the target audience "hobby chefs" and the theme "future".

Our group consistent of three people and my tasks contained programming of the whole project, modeling, texturing and rendering of the kitchen.

You can try the cooking simulation yourself at [lab.jonasgerdes.com/futurekitchen](https://lab.jonasgerdes.com/futurekitchen).

{{< aside >}}The simulation was developt and optimized for desktop browsers (in particular Chrome und Firefox) and most probably won't run like expected on tablest or smartphones.{{< /aside >}}
